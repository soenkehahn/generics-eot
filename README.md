`generics-eot` is a library for datatype generic programming that tries to be
very simple to understand and use.

Documentation can be found here: https://generics-eot.readthedocs.io/

## Alternatives

- [`generics-sop`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/generics-sop) - `generics-eot` is heavily inspired by this awesome package.
- There's a fork of `generics-eot` vendored into [`knit`](https://github.com/pkamenarsky/knit): [`knit/vendor/generics-eot`](https://github.com/pkamenarsky/knit/tree/master/vendor/generics-eot). It gives access to field names of record types at the type-level, which the version at [github.com/soenkehahn/generics-eot](https://github.com/soenkehahn/generics-eot) does not.
